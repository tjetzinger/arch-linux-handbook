Hi Heikki,

Here are the logs from two test scenarios. Both tests confirm the issue persists regardless of UCSI driver status.

## System Info
- ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 (21HMCTO1WW)
- BIOS: N3XET63W (1.38)
- Kernel: 6.18.2-zen2-1-zen (custom build, also tested on stock 6.12)
- Dock: ThinkPad USB-C Dock Gen2 (40AS)

## Test 1: UCSI Enabled (Normal Configuration)

**Boot with dock connected:** USB 3.0 works
- Ethernet (17ef:a387) on Bus 002 @ 5000M
- USB3.1 Hub (17ef:a391) on Bus 002 @ 10000M

**After disconnect + reconnect:** USB 3.0 FAILS
- Only USB 2.0 devices enumerate (480M on Bus 003)
- Bus 002 (20Gbps SuperSpeed) is completely empty
- Ethernet and USB 3.0 hub missing

Key log pattern:
```
usb usb1: root hub lost power or was reset
usb usb2: root hub lost power or was reset
usb 3-3: new high-speed USB device number 14 using xhci_hcd  ← USB 2.0 only
```

## Test 2: UCSI Disabled (blacklist ucsi_acpi)

**Boot with dock connected:** USB 3.0 works (same as Test 1)

**After disconnect + reconnect:** USB 3.0 STILL FAILS
- Identical failure pattern to Test 1
- Same "root hub lost power or was reset" messages
- Only high-speed (USB 2.0) enumeration

## Conclusion

Disabling UCSI does NOT resolve the issue. The problem appears to be in the USB-C/Thunderbolt physical layer negotiation, not the UCSI driver. The repeated "root hub lost power or was reset" messages on usb1/usb2 (Thunderbolt/USB4 buses) during hot-plug suggest the xHCI controller is being reset but failing to re-enumerate SuperSpeed devices.
